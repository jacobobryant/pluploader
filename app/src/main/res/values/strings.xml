<string name="info_dialog_msg"><![CDATA[<p>This app uploads your playlists to a server. The
        server compares them with playlists from other users and sends back a list of
        recommendations. Each recommended song is selected based on how similar it is to one of
        your playlists. The recommendations are automatically refreshed every seven days.</p>

    <p>Coming soon: use playlists from other cloud music services such as Google Music and
        Amazon Music.</p>

    <p>Thanks for contributing to our research project by using this app. Your efforts will
        enrich the lives of millions. Please consider <a
