        about your role as a research participant <a href="http://192.34.57.201/consent.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>By continuing, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and received a

<string name="info_dialog_msg"><![CDATA[<p>This app uploads your playlists to a server. The
        server compares them with playlists from other users and sends back a list of
        recommendations. Each recommended song is selected based on how similar it is to one of
        your playlists. The recommendations are automatically refreshed every seven days.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, Google Music and Amazon Music do not allow third parties to see your playlists, so
        only Spotify playlists (in addition to the playlists stored locally on your device) are available
        to this app.</p>

    <p>Thanks for contributing to our research project. Your efforts will enrich the lives of
        millions. Please consider <a
            href="mailto:jacobobryant7@gmail.com">sending me feedback</a>. You may also review
        the <a href="http://192.34.57.201/consent.pdf">research subject consent agreement</a>.
