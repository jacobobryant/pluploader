<string name="info_dialog_msg"><![CDATA[<p>This app uploads your playlists to a server. The
        server compares them with playlists from other users and sends back a list of
        recommendations. Each recommended song is selected based on how similar it is to one of
        your playlists. The recommendations are automatically refreshed every seven days.</p>

        <p>Currently, the app doesn&#8217;t retrieve any playlists you may have in Spotify, Google
        Music, Amazon Music or any other cloud music services. I&#8217;m planning to change that
        soon.</p>

        <p>Thanks for contributing to our research project by using this app. Please
        <a href="mailto:jacobobryant7@gmail.com">send me an email</a> with any feedback you have.
